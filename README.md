Hello! This is a little run down on how to do all of this but first let me give you some info on what the character is, (I have taken down the one on the 3d printing website to avoid confusion.)
The character is from a game called one shot golf, its an app on IOS and ANDROID where you can control real robots to put a golfball in a points, and points can be redeemed for prizes like gift cards etc etc, The character is a golfball with legs and funny looking shoes. Thats it.

I've created these items on tinker cad so that you can edit them anyway you'd like, if you don't know how to use tinkercad look it up.

Happy putting!!
