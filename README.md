Hello! This is a little run down on how to do all of this but first let me give you some info on what the character is, (I have taken down the one on the 3d printing website to avoid confusion.)
The character was from a game called one shot golf, it was an app on IOS and ANDROID where you could control real robots to put a golfball in a points, and points could be redeemed for prizes like gift cards etc etc, The character is a golfball with legs and funny looking shoes. Thats it.

I've created these items on tinker cad so that you can edit them anyway you'd like, if you don't know how to use tinkercad look it up.

If you are having issues with downloading remember to comment the issue and you can download using the alternitave downloading branch.

Happy putting!!
